# Master_Thesis

The datasets selected within this thesis are fully accessible via two distinct CSV files available in the provided [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kokoch/Master_Thesis/tree/main/Datasets/content). 
The first file, `Datasets_v1.csv`, contains the raw data as initially collected, offering an unaltered view of the CSV file as it was originally composed. 
The second file, `Datasets_v2.csv`, represents a refined version where 23 datasets have been meticulously selected for final analysis. This version presents columns formatted for enhanced clarity and consistency and includes a comprehensive quality evaluation of the data.

Furthermore, a Jupyter Notebook is available for facilitating data exploration, providing a guided pathway to navigating and interpreting the datasets with greater ease and insight. 
Access to the Jupyter Notebook directly through the [Jupyter Notebook link](https://github.com/Kokoch/Master_Thesis/blob/main/Datasets/Data_Visualisation.ipynb).
