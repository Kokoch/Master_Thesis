# Selecting Quality Image Datasets for Ecosystem Resilience Analysis
Welcome to the repository for my thesis project on assessing the quality of image datasets used to study ecosystem resilience. This thesis aims to develop an approach for evaluating the quality image datasets based on metrics defined by various stakeholders.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

1. **Datasets**:
    - Contains an XLS file of the metadata for the datasets found.

2. **Framework**:
    - Contains the Python implementation of our approach to assess the quality of image datasets based on stakeholder needs.
    - Files included:
        - `cli.py`: Implementation of the CLI class.
        - `datasets.py`: Implementation of the Datasets class.
        - `framework.py`: Implementation of the Framework class.
        - `metrics.py`: Implementation of the Metrics class.

3. **Case Study**:
    - Contains the code for running the case study.
    - Includes YAML files for importing metrics and loading datasets.
